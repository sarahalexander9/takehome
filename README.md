The idea of this project is to mimic Notion - having a place where you can organize your thoughts, tasks, and time. There is a subtle countdown to the New Year at the top to give a gentle reminder to the user of the timeline in which they can set any goals before the year ends. The user is able to add to-do tasks and delete them as they accomplish it throughout the day. There is then a timer to the end of the day and calendar at the bottom of the page to help visualize where they are in the week. 

Moving forward with the design aspect, I want to possibly think about changing the tasks in the to-do section to checkboxes so that by the end of the day, they can see everything they've done. Ideally, I wanted to add a section where the user can add top 3 long term goals to help remind them what they are working towards. With the calendar at the bottom, I wanted to add a section where the user could add specific deadlines to days. I also wanted to add some sort of visualization aspect to the hours left in a day so that the user can appropriately break up the time they have left for the amount of tasks to get done. 

Overall, this was heading in the direction of an online journal and organizer for people who want to become a little more structured- based on post graduation life and making it up to me to effectively manage my time :)
